			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The River Run Guides website is all about helping people find info on fly fishing trips and making it super easy to book a guide.</p>
			<p>I want it to be a cool spot where fishing fans can plan their next adventure without any hassle.</p>
			<p>It’s also a way to connect folks with awesome guides for some epic time on the river.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This site is for fly fishing lovers who want to level up their skills, newbies who are just starting out and need some help, and tourists looking for a fun outdoor thing to do.</p>
			<p>It’s also great for families or friends who wanna hang out and fish together.</p>
			<p>Basically, anyone who thinks fly fishing sounds awesome is who I’m aiming for!</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I’ll use JavaScript to make a booking form that checks if you filled it out right, a gallery of fishing spots you can click through, and a map to show where the spots are.</p>
			<p>These will make the site interactive and fun to use.</p>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<h4>Heading Font: Arial</h4>
			<h4>Paragraph Font: Times New Roman</h4>
			<p>I picked Arial for headings because it’s clean and simple, and Times New Roman for paragraphs because it’s easy to read.</p>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat.
